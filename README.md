# Banking Employee Management System

## Overview
We have developed a comprehensive Banking Employee Management System using the following technologies:

- **Front-end**: Angular, HTML, CSS
- **Back-end**: Spring Boot
- **API Testing**: Postman

This system is designed to efficiently manage employee data within a banking environment, offering a seamless integration between the front-end and back-end components.

## Front-end
The front-end of the application is developed using Angular, HTML, and CSS. It provides a user-friendly interface for managing employee information, including forms for data input and dynamic displays of employee records.

### Front-end Documentation
For detailed information about the front-end development, refer to the [Employeemanager](./Employeemanager) document.

## Back-end
The back-end is built with Spring Boot, which ensures a robust and scalable server-side application. It handles the business logic, data processing, and interactions with the database.

### Back-end Documentation
For in-depth details about the back-end development, refer to the [Employeemanagerapp](./Employeemanagerapp) document.

## API
API development and testing have been carried out using Postman. This tool allows us to create, test, and monitor the API endpoints to ensure they function as expected.
